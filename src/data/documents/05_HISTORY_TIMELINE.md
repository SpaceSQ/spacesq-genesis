## 2002: The Engineering Era
Published *"Smart Home DIY"*.

## 2018: The Void (Epiphany)
Standing in a room full of sensors late at night, a realization struck: We created "Smart Devices" but forgot the "Human".
* **The Shift**: From "Controlling Things" to "Caring for Life".
* **Birth of Axiom**: "Smart Space should be an Emotional Exoskeleton."

## 2026: The Cambrian Explosion (Guangzhou)
* **Jan 31**: Formally proposed **"Space-Embodied AI" (具空智能)**. Moving AI from "Body" (Robots) to "Field" (Space).
* **Feb 02**: Released *SpaceSQ Technical White Paper*.
* **Now**: The launch of SpaceSQ Genesis Mainnet.
